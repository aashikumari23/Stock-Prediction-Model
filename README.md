# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction Using LSTM + GAT + DGLSTM

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid deep learning pipeline that leverages **LSTM**, **DGLSTM-based dynamic graph construction**, and **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** to predict stock performance and rank the most profitable stocks using **Top-K evaluation metrics**.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The project aims to predict which stocks are most likely to be profitable in the next time step, using:

- **LSTM**: For learning temporal patterns from historical stock features.
- **DGLSTM**: For generating dynamic graph adjacency matrices based on LSTM embeddings.
- **GAT**: For capturing inter-stock relationships and enhancing embeddings through attention.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### 1. **LSTM Embeddings**
- Precomputed embeddings from a trained LSTM model capture temporal dependencies in stock price movement.
- Embeddings are L2 normalized before feeding into GAT.

### 2. **Dynamic Graph Construction (DGLSTM)**
- A dynamic graph is created for each split (`train`, `val`, `test`) using similarity among LSTM embeddings.
- Edges are weighted based on similarity scores between stocks.

### 3. **GAT Predictor**
- A Graph Attention Network is applied to the normalized LSTM embeddings and dynamically constructed graph.
- Produces enhanced node embeddings and binary predictions (profitable or not).

### 4. **Training & Validation**
- Uses Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss.
- Best model checkpoint is saved based on validation loss.
- Final evaluation is conducted on the test set.

### 5. **Evaluation**
Evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy**: % of Top-K predicted stocks labeled as profitable.
- **Precision**: Overlap between Top-K predicted vs Top-K actual returns.
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Inverse average rank of actual Top-K return stocks in predicted list.
- **IRR (Inverse Return Rank)**: Inverse average rank of predicted Top-K stocks in true return list.
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error between predicted score and actual return for Top-K.
